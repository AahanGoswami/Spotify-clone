# Spotify-Clone

This is a clone of the Spotify website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can play 5 preloaded songs, which can be navigated using the previous and next buttons. The song can also be played or paused using the play/pause button.

Both the volume bar and progress bar are fully functional, allowing users to change the song volume and jump to specific parts of the track. A search button is also included — clicking it reveals a search bar. However, actual song search is not supported, as there's no large music database connected.

Users can also like a song — clicking the heart button changes it from a hollow heart to a solid one, just like on Spotify.

Sometimes, when using the GitHub-hosted version, there may be a slight delay in updating icons or images during play/pause or song change actions. This is likely due to network latency, as the website runs smoothly when executed locally on a laptop.
